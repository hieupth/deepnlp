# DeepNLP
This is a new natural language processing library based on modern deep learning methods. The library focus on basic NLP tasks such as: POS (part of speech), NER (named entity recognition) and DP (dependency parsing). The main language is English but we are working hard to support Vietnamese and others in the near future.

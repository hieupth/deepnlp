# DeepNLP
This is a new natural language processing library based on modern deep learning methods. The library focus on basic NLP tasks such as: POS (part of speech), NER (named entity recognition) and DP (dependency parsing). The main language is English but we are working hard to support Vietnamese and others in the near future.

## Installation ðŸ”¥
- This repository is tested on python 3.7+ and Tensorflow 2.8+
- Deepnlp can be installed using pip as follows: 
```
pip install deepnlp-cerelab 
```
- Deepnlp can also be installed from source with the following commands: 
```
git clone https://github.com/hieupth/deepnlp.git
cd deepnlp/
pip install -e .
```

### 1. Sentence Segmentation
<a name= 'sentence_tokenize'></a>
Usage

```python
>>> import deepnlp 
>>> text = """\
Mr. Smith bought cheapsite.com for 1.5 million dollars, i.e. he paid a lot for it. Did he mind? Adam Jones Jr. thinks he didn't. In any case, this isn't true... Well, with a probability of .9 it isn't.
"""
>>> deepnlp.sentence_tokenize(text)
['Mr. Smith bought cheapsite.com for 1.5 million dollars, i.e. he paid a lot for it.',
 'Did he mind?',
 "Adam Jones Jr. thinks he didn't.",
 "In any case, this isn't true...",
 "Well, with a probability of .9 it isn't.",
 '']
```
### 2. Word Tokenize
Usage
<a name= 'word_tokenize'> </a>

```python
>>> import deepnlp 
>>> text = "I have an apple."
>>> deepnlp.word_tokenize(text)
['I', 'have', 'an', 'apple', '.']
```
### 3. Install and load pretrained model and vocabs 
- Install pretrained model and vocabs
<a name= 'pretrained'></a>

```python 
>>> import deepnlp
>>> deepnlp.download('deepnlp_eng')
```
- Or you can also install pretrained model and vocabs independently of each other 

```python
>>> import deepnlp 
>>> deepnlp.download_model('deepnlp_eng')
>>> deepnlp.download_vocabs('deepnlp_eng')
```
- Load models and vocabs 

```python
>>> import deepnlp 
>>> model = deepnlp.load_model('deepnlp_eng')
>>> vocabs= deepnlp.load_vocabs('deepnlp_eng', task= 'multi') # pos, ner, dp
```
### 4. POS Tagging
<a name= 'xpos'></a>

- With `PosTagger` class 
```python
>>> import deepnlp
>>> model= deepnlp.PosTagger('deepnlp_eng')
>>> model 
model_name: deepnlp_eng, vocab_name: deepnlp_eng, tokenizer_name: distilroberta-base
>>> output= model.inference('I have an apple.', device= 'cpu') # default device = 'cpu'
>>> output
<deepnlp.utils.data_struct.TokenClassificationData at 0x7fbc3ddbab90>
>>> output.value()
{'Sequence': 'I have an apple.',
 'Inference': {'I': {'score': 0.9175689, 'label': 'PRP'},
  'have': {'score': 0.9232193, 'label': 'VBP'},
  'an': {'score': 0.9158458, 'label': 'DT'},
  'apple': {'score': 0.86957675, 'label': 'NN'},
  '.': {'score': 0.8892631, 'label': '.'}}}
>>> deepnlp.print_out([output])
I have an apple.
1	I	PRP
2	have	VBP
3	an	DT
4	apple	NN
5	.       .
```
